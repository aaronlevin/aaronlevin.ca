Here is a list of things I am interested in:

- mathematics
- functional programming
- rare records
- marxism and democratically-planned economies
- empathy
- feminism
- canada

I hold an MSc. in Pure Mathematics from the University of Alberta. My thesis was titled: **Extension of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem to Semigroups of Positive Operators on Order-Continuous Banach Lattices**. Perron-Frobenius is a theorem concerning indecomposible, positive matrices and is used extensively in [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank).

I am currently employed as a software engineer. I write a lot of Scala (and some Clojure) for [Sortable](http://www.sortable.com). It took a while to get here, but I really enjoy programming.

In 2009 I founded [weird canada](http://weirdcanada.com), a website dedicated to encouraging, documenting, and connecting emerging music across Canada. From its humble beginnings as a place for my hyperbolic-driven missives on the minutiae of drone cassettes made in rural Albertan basements, it has  emerged as a leader in emerging arts dialogue in Canada. It was also named ["Best Indie Music Website in Canada"](http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2011/3/Edmontons-Weird-Canada-named-Best-Canadian-Music-Site) by CBC Radio 3.

I collect records of all genres, especially independently released Canadian LPs.

If you are interested in talking about mathematics, functional programming, rare records, marxism, or feminism, please email me: aaron@weirdcanada.com or follow me on twitter [@aaronmblevin](http://twitter.com/aaronmblevin).
